features:
  - icon: 📊
    title: Schema-First Development
    details: Define your application state schema upfront using TypeScript and Zod for type safety, validation, and better developer experience. Catch errors at compile time instead of runtime.

  - icon: 🧩
    title: Atomic Component Design
    details: Organize components into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. Create a consistent design system that scales with your application and team.

  - icon: ⚡
    title: Event-Driven Architecture
    details: Decouple components through a central event system. Components emit events without knowing who's listening, making your application more maintainable and testable.

  - icon: 🔍
    title: Zero Prop Drilling
    details: Access state and dispatch events from anywhere using custom React hooks. Eliminate the need to pass props through multiple component layers, simplifying your component API.

  - icon: 🧪
    title: Highly Testable
    details: Write unit tests for isolated components, integration tests for connected ones, and E2E tests for critical flows. Achieve high test coverage with minimal effort.

  - icon: 🎨
    title: Modern Design System
    details: Leverage shadcn's accessible components with Tailwind CSS to create beautiful, responsive UIs that maintain consistency across your entire application.
