# Components Overview

The Quantum Reactor Pattern uses Atomic Design principles to organize UI components into a hierarchical structure, making them more reusable, testable, and maintainable.

## Atomic Design Methodology

Atomic Design is a methodology composed of five distinct stages working together to create interface design systems in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner:

1. **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, labels)
2. **Molecules**: Simple groups of UI elements functioning together (form fields, search bars)
3. **Organisms**: Complex UI components composed of molecules and atoms (navigation bars, product lists)
4. **Templates**: Page-level layouts without specific content
5. **Pages**: Specific instances of templates with real content

## Benefits in the Quantum Reactor Pattern

In the Quantum Reactor Pattern, Atomic Design helps to:

- **Maintain consistency** across your application
- **Increase reusability** of components
- **Improve development speed** through composition
- **Enhance testability** by isolating components
- **Simplify maintenance** through clear responsibility boundaries

## Implementation with React and shadcn

The Quantum Reactor Pattern implements Atomic Design using React components and enhances them with:

- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **shadcn/ui** for accessible, customizable component primitives
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Clear file organization** to match the atomic hierarchy

## Directory Structure

```
/components
  /atoms       # Basic UI elements
  /molecules   # Simple combinations of atoms
  /organisms   # Complex UI sections composed of molecules/atoms
  /templates   # Page layouts without content
  /pages       # Specific instances of templates with content
```

## Integration with State Management

Atoms and molecules are generally "dumb" components that don't contain state logic, while organisms and pages can connect to the application state through custom hooks:

```tsx
// Example of an organism connecting to state
import { useProducts } from '../../hooks/useProducts';

export function ProductList() {
  // State accessed through a custom hook, not props
  const { products, loading, error } = useProducts();
  
  // Component implementation...
}
```
